				Hackathon challenge given by TomTom. The challenge was to create an app that would find the shortest route for a garbage collector to collect trash given locations in a city. I worked in a team of 3 others, 2 of which I was not very familiar with. I worked with a diverse team and was responsible for calculating the best route while my other teammates were responsible for the front and backend of the app. We were able to work well and won 1st place in the challenge.

				Coursera’s online Machine Learning class taught by Andrew Ng. I learned how to work with large data set and matrices, neural networks, principal component analysis, linear algebra applications, and other similar topics.

				The goal of this project was to create a way of measuring similarity between songs. We simplified our target to electronic music and spent hours researching how similarity is measured in songs and sections that define types of electronic music. I tried developing a system that would count the number of times the same beat occurred but we realized that this was a superficial answer to the problem so we used libraries, like scikit-learn, to model the data of the songs in different ways. However, this was as far as we could go.
